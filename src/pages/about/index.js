          description="When I was four I kept a notebook of inventions. Under the title Inventor Jaime Gadget, I dreamed of a future, sketched out in heavy black pencil, where everything could fly. I wanted to build the mythical and magical, creations unconstrained by what I was taught possible. Elementary school lunches were spent pouring over Star Wars cross sections as I searched for answers to the mysteries of designing light-sabers and X-wings. So I sketched diagrams and labeled measurements and specifications, envisioning how to bring these dreams to life."

A local parent in the community noticed, and asked me to design a logo for her company, a womenâ€™s health and beauty startup called Flora. During this time, I also discovered the joy of Physics and Math though AP classes and on the weekends I busked with my violin around the bay."

          description="Over the summer leading up to college, I began teaching myself web development. When I arrived at school I took upper level computer science courses, and was invited to stay on over summer as a researcher developing a cybersecurity platform called EDURange. I was drawn towards making the platform more engaging and accessible, which lead me to redesign and develop its new interface. After completing my research that summer, I started a design shop called On Point Design. I also collaborated with a film student and friend to assist in the direction of, and act in an original feature length film called Malaria."

We won and were awarded a five thousand dollar prize. As I continued my academic studies, I focused my major on Mathematics and Physics, and I was invited to join the honorary mathematics society, Pi Mu Epsilon. I played violin in the collegeâ€™s symphony and performed in the theatre departmentâ€™s production of the musical, Spring Awakening (in the challenging role of Hanschen) During this time, I also continued to expand On Point Design, and took on clients such as World Music Entertainment, Hurst Creative, the Sausalito Art Festival as well as various startups in the Portland area. In my last semester, I interned as the product designer on a mobile app for eBayâ€™s charity department."

After a successful product launch, I left for India to volunteer at a summer camp in Janwar, Madhya Pradesh. Taking inspiration from Skateistan, a German woman Ulrike built a skate park there which has encouraged community development and academic participation. While in Janwar, I taught music and english, and for the first time saw how powerful an impact changes in infrastructure can have on a community."

While there, I worked as a UX designer on products for Microsoft, Ameri can Express, Juniper Networks, and others. I have since joined Facebook as a product designer on their Enterprise Engineering team, designing software for use across internal supply chains. While my work has allowed for an improvement in the experience of many users, the scope has felt narrow. Design can go beyond a human centered approach to a humanity centered one. I plan to use the skills I possess and learn many more in order to tackle the problems that affect us all globally, to design change the world needs."
