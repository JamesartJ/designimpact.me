          description="When I was four I kept a notebook of inventions. Under the monicker Inventor Jaime Gadget, I dreamed of a future, sketched out in heavy black pencil, where everything could fly. Elementary school lunches were spent pouring over Star Wars cross sections as I searched for answers to the mysteries of designing lightsabers and X-wings. I wanted to build the mythical and magical, creations unconstrained by what I was taught possible. So I sketched diagrams and labeled the measurements and specifications, envisioning how to bring these dreams to life."

When I arrived at school I took upper level computer science course, and was invited to stay on over summer as a researcher developing a cybersecurity platform called <u>EDURange</u>. I was quickly drawn towards ways to make the platform more engaging and accessible, which lead me to redesign and develop an new interface for it. After research that summer, I started a design shop with another pier called <u>On Point Design</u>, and acted in as well as helped to direct a feature called Malaria."

As I continued my academic studies, I focused my major on Mathematics and Physics, and I was invited to join the honorary national mathematics society, Pi Mu Epsilon. I played violin in the collegeâ€™s symphony and performed in the theatre departmentâ€™s production of the musical, <u>Spring Awakening</u>. During this time, I also continued to expand On Point Design, and took on clients such as World Music Entertainment, Hurst Creative, the Sausalito Art Festival as well as various startups in the Portland area. In my last semester, I interned as the product designer on a mobile app for eBayâ€™s charity department."

I have since joined Facebook as a product designer on their bizapps team, designing software for use across internal supply chains. While my work has allowed for an improvement in the experience of many users, the scope has been narrow. Design can go beyond a human centered approach to a humanity centered one. I plan to use of these skills, and the many more to learn, in order to tackle the problems that affect us all globally, to design impact."
