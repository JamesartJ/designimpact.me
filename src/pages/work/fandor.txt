                As part of a cross platform redesign of Fandorâ€™s applications, I
                worked as a supporting UX designer for their web experience and
                as the lead designer on their TV application. Using personas and
                competitive analysis, I designed both low and high fidelity
                wireframes which were handed off to visual design before being
                delivered to the client.
